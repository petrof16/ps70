### About Me

I am a pianist/composer, born in Havana, Cuba. I crossed the Mexican border into Texas with my family when I was nine years old. We claimed political asylum and settled in Miami, Florida in 1993. I moved to NYC in 2003, where I met my wonderful wife. We now have a nutty 2 year old son who I love very much. In 2016 I founded an environmentally-conscious indie music label called Biophilia Records and I have been nominated twice for a grammy.
