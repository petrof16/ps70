#### Week 1: Introduction 

3 Ideas for final project:

1. Acoustic pianos typically have 3 pedals that alter the timbre of the strings. I would like to design a portable, 4th pedal (on the left side) that can play harmonics in the middle register of the piano. Using the fender rhodes sustain pedal as a starting off point.

2. A 5th pedal that half mutes the strings in the lower and middle register of the piano.

3. Create an "arm" that attaches to the piano bench where a laptop, effects pedals, typing keyboard, ect... can be easily be placed. The "arm" can be moved and locked to varying locations so taht the pianist can quickly put it in front of them or to the side during a performance. 

Here is an image:
