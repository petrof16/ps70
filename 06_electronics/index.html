#### Week 6: Electronic Input Devices 

Because it is difficult to be able to practice my piano during the day (due to my toddler son insisting that I either stop and play with him, or that he be the one playing the piano), I recently had the QuietTime ProRecord module added to my acoustic grand piano. Through a series of infra red leds tucked underneath the keybed, it is possible to read the velocity of the key strikes. From these data, MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) messages can be sent out. This video was very helpful:

I used the arduino uno to behave as an input, receiving the MIDI out messages that get sent out from the piano. 

This is what the schematic looks like for the MIDI input circuit:

I needed to use an 6n138 optocoupler chip. Inside of this little chip there is an infrared LED that flashes on one side and is read on the other side. That is how it communicates the bits in the information flow. Pin 8 on the chip connects to the positive and pin 5 to ground. 

The Midi jack has 5 pin connections; I connected to pins 4 and 5 to transmit the Midi note messages.

On the coding end, I needed to use the Arduino MIDI Library. The easiest way of seeing if I was receiving the MIDI data, was to have the built in LED on pin 13, which looks like this:

<code>

  #include <MIDI.h>  // Add Midi Library

#define LED 13

MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE();

void setup() {
  pinMode (LED, OUTPUT); 
  MIDI.begin(MIDI_CHANNEL_OMNI); // Listens to all midi channels

  MIDI.setHandleNoteOn(MyHandleNoteOn); 
  MIDI.setHandleNoteOff(MyHandleNoteOff); 
}

void loop() {
  MIDI.read(); // Constantly checks to see if Midi data has been received.
}

void MyHandleNoteOn(byte channel, byte pitch, byte velocity) { 
  digitalWrite(LED,HIGH);
}

void MyHandleNoteOff(byte channel, byte pitch, byte velocity) { 
  digitalWrite(LED,LOW); 
}

}</code>
