#### Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication

I am making a cowbell playing kinetic sculpture. 

<img src="../images/platform.jpeg" alt="platform" width="484" height="363">

I screwed a metal rod onto a wooden platform. Next, I cut two wooden square rods to the same length using the band saw.

I then drilled a single hole in each of the wooden sticks so that I may thread a thin metal rod through them that would provide the fulcrum. I put some tape on the thin metal rod between the two wooden, square sticks so that they would remain the correct length apart. 

<img src="../images/metal.jpeg" alt="motor" width="484" height="363">

In order to screw the motor onto the wooden platform, I drilled two holes onto a thin metal sheet and bent it so that the motor would reside between the cowbell and the fulcrum. Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's Power hammer, I modelled two small cams using fusion 360.

One would have a horizontal hole for the motor arm, and the other, a vertical hole to fit over the motor arm.

<img src="../images/horizontal.jpeg" alt="horizontal" width="144" height="144">

<img src="../images/vertical.jpeg" alt="vertical" width="144" height="144">

<img src="../images/cams.jpeg" alt="cams" width="484" height="363">

Six equal-height feet were glued onto the bottom of the platform to provide space for the screws extruding fromt the bottom. I assume it will also help with the sound production.
